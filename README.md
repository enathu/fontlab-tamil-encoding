###Tamil Encoding for FontLab

Here I am compiling a encoding file (*.enc) that can be used in Tamil unicode font development.

Currently the repository is empty as I am testing different types of naming conventions and I'll update with the Encoding file as soon as I feel it's ready to be shipped.

####Contribute
